ðŸ”¸ I am a professional software developer and architect with 10+ years of experience. However, I prefer to talk about myself as a problem solver and a reliable partner who helps to digitalize your ideas and create beautiful software solutions. 

ðŸ”¸ I have a clear understanding of every step that needs to be taken from the first draft written on a bunch of sticky notes to the sophisticated web platform deployed to production. As I have successfully done this many times, I know the pitfalls and how to avoid them. I would love to apply my experience to your project. Letâ€™s rock the world by bringing your innovative ideas to life! 

Let me tell you a bit about my background.

ðŸ”¸ I started my career developing enterprise desktop applications using Microsoftâ€™s stack of technologies. Since that time dozens of APIs have been developed, hundreds of database tables have been designed, thousands of lines of code have been written, and an exceptional amount of positive interactions have taken place while working together with my clients and teammates.

ðŸ”¸ For the last five years, Iâ€™ve been focusing on web development. I love to build systems from scratch. My last two projects were startups where my role was Full Stack Developer and Tech Lead.

ðŸ”¸ As a Full Stack Developer, Iâ€™m passionate about project architecture, and writing clean, testable code using the best practices and design patterns. Frameworks that I normally use in my projects are ASP.NET Core and Angular.

ðŸ”¸ As a Tech Lead, I have vast experience in providing a clear and transparent interaction between business and development departments. I have built several teams and all the infrastructure necessary for their management. This position has usually required me to combine several roles such as architect, developer, mentor, project manager, DevOps engineer, and recruiter. 

ðŸ”¸ As well as being able to build everything from the ground up, I can also contribute to an existing project. I have no problem dealing with legacy code and have extensive experience in refactoring and optimization. I can play the role of an all-in-one independent executor as well as a friendly and responsible team member.
